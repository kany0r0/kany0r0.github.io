summary: A look at how my system is setup
---

My current setup involves an Arch Linux operating system running on top of this an [i3 window titling manager](i3wm.org). Although a lot of configuration will be required in this setup, it will provide a base for a really fast minimal system.

I make extensive use of terminal apps i.e applications running on the terminal with ncurses-based interfaces(text apps) and only resort to GUI apps when the current task requires a GUI interface or provides more productivity. Some of this apps include

* Vim - Text Editor
* Ranger - File manager with vim-bindings
* zathura - pdf reader
* gpicview - Image viewer
* mpv - Video player
* cmus - Music player

Some other cool stuff

* git - Open source distributed version control system
* GNS3 - Graphical Network Simulator
* Wireshack - Network Protocol Analyzer
* VirtualBox - Virtualization software
