Hello,

Welcome to the Ugly Pengiun, built using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) a tool that transforms plain text to static sites. The gist of it is that you write your posts in markdown which is basically plain text with some syntatic magic and jekyll with the help of [Liquid](http://docs.shopify.com/themes/liquid-basics) a templating engine, transforms this plain text into static websites or blog posts. 

The static sites produced tie up really nicely with [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com) that will provide you with free hosting as long as you have a github account.
